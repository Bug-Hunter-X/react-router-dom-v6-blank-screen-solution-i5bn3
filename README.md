# React Router Dom v6 Blank Screen Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6: a blank screen despite correctly defining routes.  The issue arises from a seemingly innocuous oversight in the component structure or the way routes are handled.

## Problem

The provided code includes the necessary imports and structure for React Router v6, yet it fails to render any components. A blank screen is displayed, and the application seemingly doesn't react to navigation changes.

## Solution

A common cause for this is improper nesting of components or incorrect use of the Routes element. The solution involves carefully examining component hierarchy and ensuring components are correctly nested within the <Routes> component.
